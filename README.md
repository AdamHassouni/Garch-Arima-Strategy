# Financial Strategy Analysis using ARIMA+GARCH Models

This project explores the implementation and comparison of an ARIMA+GARCH model against a traditional Buy & Hold strategy. The ARIMA+GARCH model is used to forecast stock returns and manage risk, providing insights into the effectiveness of sophisticated statistical models in financial trading.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of an ARIMA+GARCH model in forecasting stock returns and managing risk, and to compare it with the traditional Buy & Hold strategy. The analysis includes generating various plots to visualize and interpret the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- R packages: `xts`, `zoo`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `quantmod`

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-strategy-analysis.git
   cd financial-strategy-analysis
2. **Install R**:
   ```bash
   install.packages(c("xts", "zoo", "PerformanceAnalytics", "quantmod"))
## Data Preparation
1. Ensure you have your forecasts.csv file in the project directory
2. Run the Python script to process the CSV file

# Methodology
## ARIMA
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is used to model the mean of the time series data. It helps in capturing the autocorrelation in stock prices, allowing for better prediction of future price movements based on historical data.

## GARCH
GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) is used to model the variance of the returns. It addresses volatility clustering, a common characteristic in financial time series where periods of high volatility are followed by high volatility and vice versa.

Analysis and Visualization
## Cumulative Returns
Calculates the cumulative returns for both ARIMA+GARCH and Buy & Hold strategies and visualizes them over time.

## Rolling Volatility
Plots the rolling volatility to show how risk changes over time.

## Drawdowns
Illustrates the peak-to-trough declines, highlighting periods of significant loss.

## Rolling Returns
Shows average returns over moving time windows, providing insight into the consistency of returns.

## Rolling Sharpe Ratios
Indicates the risk-adjusted returns over time, allowing for comparison of performance adjusted for risk.

## Results
The ARIMA+GARCH model is compared to the Buy & Hold strategy using various visualizations. The plots help in understanding the performance, risk, and return characteristics of each strategy.

## Conclusion
The ARIMA+GARCH model demonstrates robust risk-adjusted returns, providing valuable insights for better risk management and enhanced trading strategies compared to the traditional Buy & Hold approach.
